## Creative coding with Unity

Hi, I'm a student of the HSLU and study IT and Design. On this site I will document the progress my mentorting in the semester of fall 2022, in which I'm exploring how to use unity for creative or generative coding. So stay put and look forward to what I will achive!

### Getting started
For this project I wanted to do version control with GitHub and use GitHub pages with a Jekyll theme to show the documentation. When I started a month ago, I thought, that this would be simple. Guess what? It wasn't! I'm new to Unity, GitHub and Jekyll and I got the impression, that there are a thousend ways to get the three of them working together. And belive me, I wrecked them all! I tried to set it up with Git Bash, cmd, Git Desktop and GitHub remote. I used many diffrent versions of gemfiles, .gitignores and tried out a bunch of Jekyll themes. Sometimes I was angry and desperate and often deleted the whole thing just to restart again. But here I am, the page is up and working and I'm finally ready to go. Whoop, whoop!
