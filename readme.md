# MENTORING3

## Creative coding with Unity

Hi, I'm a student of the HSLU and study IT and Design. On this site I will document the progress of my mentorting in the semester of fall 2022, in which I'm exploring how to use unity for creative or generative coding. In a discussion with my mentor Guillaume Massol I decided on four goals:

1. Get familiar with Unity and Github
2. Challange yourself with little projects
3. Get faster with coding
4. Document the process on Github

October 2022
### Getting started
For this project I wanted to do version control with GitHub and use GitHub pages with a Jekyll theme to show the documentation. I have to mention here, that I'm not familiar with both of them. When I started a month ago, I thought, that this would be simple. Guess what? It wasn't! I'm new to Unity, GitHub and Jekyll and I got the impression, that there are a thousend ways to get the three of them working together. And belive me, I wrecked them all! I tried to set it up with Git Bash, cmd, Git Desktop and GitHub remote. I used many diffrent versions of gemfiles, .gitignores and tried out a bunch of Jekyll themes. Sometimes I was angry and desperate and often deleted the whole thing just to restart again. But here I am, the page is up and working and I'm finally ready to go. Whoop, whoop!

Before taking action myselfe I wanted to dig deeper into what creative coding actually is. I found an informative page, that shows many examples of what creative software can do.

After a good talk with Dragica Kahlina, a lecturer at the HSLU, I decided to challange myselfe with building an AI that simulates a flock of birds. Therefore I researched the rules of a flock as they were phrased by Craig Reynolds. Here is, how an early implementation (1986) from C. Rynolds worked:

Because I don't really know how Unity works and I can't programm in C# I thought, it would be good to first write a little prototype in p5.js. To begin with it, I took the example from Daniel Shiffman from The Coding Train in his Coding challenge #124: Flocking Simulation.
