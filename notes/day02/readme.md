## Iterative Patterns

### Brief

Write some code to generate tiling pattern or textural composition. Give consideration to aesthetic issues like symetry, rhythm, color, details at multiple scales; precise balance of form and the balance between organic and geometric forms. The pattern should be designed so that it is infinitely tiled or extended.

__You must first sketch your idea on paper before working with the software.__ 

### Variations / Steps

- [ ] Make a grid
- [ ] Animate the elements in your grid
- [ ] Experiments with 2D graphic transformations (rotation, scaling, mirror, offset)
- [ ] Use nested iterations
- [ ] Add some [easing](https://easings.net/)
- [ ] Use a kaleidoscopic effect (you can introduce image or videos as source)
- [ ] Make it loop
- [ ] Export it as a GIF
- [ ] Add states
- [ ] Add noise / randomness
- [ ] Make it "sketchy"
- [ ] Take it to the 3rd dimension


## Deliverables

* Code and documentation of your process, add some live example + gifs / images.
* Include a scan or photo of your drawings in the post


## More on patterns

A pattern is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper. 

Try to experiment with different type of patterns, for example: Tessellations. Tessellation, or tiling in two dimensions, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. There are many forms of tesselation and you are invited to read some of the pages below to learn more about each of those tesselation technics:

## ✎ Ideas for experiments (1)

Try to recreate some of the patterns below, add interactivity. **Start simple then complexify your system gradually.**

## ✎ Ideas for experiments (2)

Let's have a look at a fun little command line code originally written in Basic on the C64 in the early 80's:

`10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10`

Even though the code in itself is similar to the algorithms that generate patterns we explored before; With certain settings the visuals it produces are quite similar to outputs generated by intelligent agents programs.

Recreate a version of 10print in p5.js and create some variations
